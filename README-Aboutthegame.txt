How to play the game, Space Bois:
You are a space ship wondering around the universe, doing your own business, when suddenly, ALIENS and METEORS are aiming to kill you, your job is to save the universe and kill as many as aliens as you can and try to not get hit by those nasty meteors. You can save your journey and continue the mission afterwards, also you can play with your mates and see who is more likely to save the universe XD (check the leader board when you lose the game tho). 
I hope you have fun playing this game. Always a pleasure.

Some cheat codes you can use (you're welcome):
